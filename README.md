These are the files that I have been using in this personal project of mine.

You'll have to forgive the messiness and overall unorganized feel of some of these scripts. I am no software developer, and a lot of this is trial and error and trying to understand how these functions and libraries work.

The calculations page in particular is definitely a work in progress. My original goal was to create a daily bourbon predictor, but that dips more into machine learning--something I know very very little about. My thought here was that I need to create meaningful data (i.e. max/min/avg number of days since a bourbon has been repeated, which bourbons favor which days, which bourbons are most likely to be availble after another bourbon has been sold the day prior) and factor those data points into some sort of algorithm that would calculate the 'weight' of all those data points and make an educated prediction on tomorrows bourbon.

A lot to work on and I have only completed a little of what I want to do, but as I learn more hopefully I'll be able to fill in those cracks.

Should be noted that not all of the work I have been doing lies in these files. I've been working on transforming and visualizing data using tableau/PowerBI desktop, and I am storing the data locally in a postgreSQL database.
